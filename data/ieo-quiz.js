This rumour reached the king Krishnadevaraya, and he decided to find out if it was true. The next day, the king ordered his guards to bring Ramayya to a room next to his private chamber so that he could see his face first thing in the morning. So the king looked at Ramayya’s face the next morning. As soon as the king sat down for breakfast, he saw a fly in one of the dishes served to him. He ordered the cooks to prepare a fresh breakfast. By the time the cooks brought in the freshly made breakfast, the king had lost his appetite. The king believed that it was all because he saw Ramayya’s face in the morning. He became angry and ordered the guards to behead Ramayya.",
